 JAM Stack :

What is the JAM Stack?

The JAM Stack is a web development architecture that revolves around JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It transforms the traditional server-side approach by shifting the heavy lifting to the client side. JavaScript takes care of dynamic content, APIs connect the site to external services, and Markup (HTML) is pre-built during the build or deploy process, resulting in static and high-performance websites.

An Analogy:

Imagine a food assembly line. JavaScript is the chef adding the final touches to make the dish dynamic and flavorful. APIs are like specialized ingredients sourced from various suppliers, enhancing the dish with unique flavors. Markup is the recipe, prepped and ready, ensuring consistency in every serving. JAM Stack streamlines this process, making your website a well-orchestrated culinary masterpiece.
