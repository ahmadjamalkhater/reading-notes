# Testing Best Practices
## Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity
unit testing improves codebase and productivity by 1. enhancing code quality and reliability 2. speeding up debugging and troubleshooting 3. and facilitating code refactoring and modularity.

## How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry.

To write a unit test for a household task like putting away laundry, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the function or method: Determine the specific function or method that is responsible for the task of putting away laundry. For example, you might have a function called putAwayLaundry().
2. Define the expected behavior: Clearly define what the expected outcome should be when the function is executed correctly. In this case, the expected behavior could be that all the laundry items are properly organized in their designated places.
3. Break down the task into testable steps: Divide the task into smaller steps or actions that can be tested individually. For example, you can have steps like sorting clothes by type, folding clothes, and placing them in their respective drawers.
4. Write test cases: Write individual test cases for each step, making sure to cover different scenarios. For example, you might have test cases to check if shirts are folded correctly, if socks are paired properly, and if all items are placed in the correct drawers.
5. Set up test data: Prepare the necessary data or objects required to perform the test. For instance, you might create a set of mock laundry items or use sample data to simulate the task.
6. Execute the test cases: Run the unit tests and verify if the actual results match the expected behavior. Assertions can be used to validate each step of the process. If any assertion fails, it indicates that there is an issue with that particular step.
7. Refine and iterate: Analyze the test results and identify any discrepancies or errors. Debug and fix any issues that are found. Repeat the testing process until all test cases pass successfully.

Remember that unit tests should be automated and repeatable, so they can be executed whenever changes are made to the code. By writing unit tests for household tasks, you can ensure the reliability and correctness of your implementation, even for seemingly simple tasks like putting away laundry.
