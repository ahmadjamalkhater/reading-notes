# Testing Best Practices
## Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity
unit testing improves codebase and productivity by 1. enhancing code quality and reliability 2. speeding up debugging and troubleshooting 3. and facilitating code refactoring and modularity.

## How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry.

To write a unit test for a household task like putting away laundry, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the function or method: Determine the specific function or method that is responsible for the task of putting away laundry. For example, you might have a function called putAwayLaundry().
2. Define the expected behavior: Clearly define what the expected outcome should be when the function is executed correctly. In this case, the expected behavior could be that all the laundry items are properly organized in their designated places.
3. Break down the task into testable steps: Divide the task into smaller steps or actions that can be tested individually. For example, you can have steps like sorting clothes by type, folding clothes, and placing them in their respective drawers.
4. Write test cases: Write individual test cases for each step, making sure to cover different scenarios. For example, you might have test cases to check if shirts are folded correctly, if socks are paired properly, and if all items are placed in the correct drawers.
5. Set up test data: Prepare the necessary data or objects required to perform the test. For instance, you might create a set of mock laundry items or use sample data to simulate the task.
6. Execute the test cases: Run the unit tests and verify if the actual results match the expected behavior. Assertions can be used to validate each step of the process. If any assertion fails, it indicates that there is an issue with that particular step.
7. Refine and iterate: Analyze the test results and identify any discrepancies or errors. Debug and fix any issues that are found. Repeat the testing process until all test cases pass successfully.

## A quality README is indeed just as important as quality code for several reasons:

1. Documentation and Communication: A well-written README serves as documentation that communicates important information about the codebase. It provides an overview of the project, its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it. This documentation helps other developers understand and work with the codebase more effectively, even if they didn't write the code themselves. It acts as a guide, explaining the project's structure, dependencies, and any specific requirements or considerations.
2. Onboarding and Collaboration: A quality README eases the onboarding process for new team members or contributors. When joining a project, developers often rely on the README to quickly grasp the project's context, goals, and guidelines. It helps them understand the development environment, installation steps, and any conventions or coding standards to follow. By providing clear instructions and explanations, a README fosters better collaboration and reduces the time spent onboarding new team members.
3. Project Visibility and Community Engagement: A README is often the first point of contact for potential users or contributors who discover a project. It presents an opportunity to showcase the project's features, benefits, and usage examples. A quality README can attract users, encourage them to try the project, and inspire contributions. It helps create a positive impression and demonstrates the project's professionalism and attention to detail. Additionally, a README that includes information about how to contribute, report issues, or contact the maintainers can encourage community engagement and foster an open-source culture.




## When writing a README for your co-developers, name 4 crucial elements to include.


1. Project Overview: Provide a clear and concise description of the project. Explain its purpose, goals, and any relevant background information. This section should give your co-developers a high-level understanding of what the project is about.
2. Installation Instructions: Detail the steps required to set up the project on a local development environment. Include any dependencies, libraries, or tools that need to be installed. Specify any configuration or environment variables that are necessary. This section should help your co-developers get the project up and running quickly.
3. Usage Guide: Explain how to use the project and its features. Provide examples, code snippets, or instructions on how to interact with the codebase. Include any command-line commands, API endpoints, or user interface guidelines. This section should serve as a practical guide for your co-developers to effectively utilize the project.
4. Contribution Guidelines: Outline the process for contributing to the project. Specify the version control workflow (e.g., Git), branch naming conventions, and any code review procedures. Explain how to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests. Include guidelines for writing clean code, documentation standards, and any testing or quality assurance practices. This section should promote collaboration and provide your co-developers with clear instructions on how to contribute to the project.
