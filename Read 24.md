## "Introduction to Identity"
I see that the reading material is about "Introduction to Identity" in the context of ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core Identity is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality and manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more. It allows users to create an account with login information stored in Identity or use external login providers like Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter.

Key points about ASP.NET Core Identity:

It provides user authentication and authorization features for ASP.NET Core web apps.
It is typically configured with a SQL Server database to store user information, but other persistent stores like Azure Table Storage can be used as well.
To enable Identity, you need to configure the services in the application's Program.cs file.
The article explains how to create a web app with authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity, including steps like applying migrations and testing the registration and login functionalities.
The article also touches on the differences between ASP.NET Core Identity and the Microsoft identity platform (Azure Active Directory).
