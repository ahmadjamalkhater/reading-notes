## What are 3 things I'll start doing to "un-stick" myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
Sometimes, when facing challenges in programming or problem-solving, it's necessary to follow strategies to effectively overcome obstacles. Here are the three things I will start doing to "un-stick" myself:

Researching and seeking help: When a difficult problem arises, I won't hesitate to research and leverage various sources such as documentation, forums, and online communities. Tapping into the knowledge and experiences of others can provide valuable insights and solutions.
Breaking down the problem into parts: Complex problems often come with significant difficulty, so it's important to break them down into manageable and bite-sized tasks. I will tackle the problem step by step and deal with each part individually. This approach helps me better understand the problem and make progress more efficiently.
Taking breaks and gaining a fresh perspective: Sometimes, stepping away from the challenging task can offer new insights. I will take short breaks to clear my mind and engage in activities that relax me. This can help me look at the problem from a fresh perspective and potentially identify alternative solutions or approaches.
