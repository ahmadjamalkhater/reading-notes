Benefits of Using Views:

Views handle data presentation and user interaction in the MVC pattern.
Views are HTML templates with embedded Razor markup.
Views in ASP.NET Core MVC are .cshtml files using C# in Razor markup.
Views are organized into folders named after controllers.
Views provide separation of concerns (SoC) and modular app design.
Creating a View:

Views specific to controllers are placed in Views/[ControllerName] folders.
Shared views among controllers are placed in Views/Shared folder.
Views are created as .cshtml files with associated controller actions.
Razor markup is used to define the content and layout of the view.
How Controllers Specify Views:

Views are typically returned from actions as ViewResults.
The View helper method is used to return views.
View discovery mechanism searches for view files based on action names.
Views can be returned explicitly by specifying view name or model.
Passing Data to Views:

Data can be passed using strongly typed viewmodels.
ViewData and ViewBag are used for weakly typed data.
ViewData is a dictionary-like collection of weakly typed objects.
ViewBag is a dynamic wrapper around ViewData.
Strongly typed viewmodels offer compile-time type checking.
CSS Isolation and Scope:

CSS isolation helps manage CSS styles on a per-page/view/component basis.
Scoped CSS files are placed in companion .cshtml.css files.
Compilation of scoped CSS occurs before framework rewrites selectors.
Scoped CSS is bundled and linked in layout using scope identifiers.
CSS preprocessors like Sass can be integrated with CSS isolation.
Razor Class Library (RCL) Support:

RCLs can provide isolated styles with a specific file structure.
Scoped CSS files are bundled and linked using package-specific paths.
The article provides in-depth information about views, their benefits,
how they are created, how controllers interact with them, 
and how data is passed to them. It also explains the concepts of CSS isolation and scope,
as well as how to achieve it in ASP.NET Core MVC applications. Additionally,
it discusses the support for scoped CSS in Razor class libraries.
