# Topic: Introduction to Databases and ERDs

Why does this topic matter as it relates to what you are studying in this module?

Understanding databases and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) is crucial for studying this module as it forms the foundation of data management and storage in software development. Databases are integral to many applications, and ERDs help in visualizing and designing the structure and relationships of the data within a database.
Reading Assignment Notes:

What is a Schema?

A database schema is a blueprint that defines the structure, organization, and relationships of the data stored in a database. It specifies tables, attributes, data types, constraints, and relationships between tables.
Why do we use Database Schemas?

Database schemas are used to organize and manage data systematically. They ensure data integrity, enforce relationships between tables, and provide a structured approach to storing and retrieving information.
What are the different types of Database Keys?

Primary Key: It is a unique identifier for each record in a table and ensures that each row is uniquely identifiable.
Foreign Key: It is a field or set of fields in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
Composite Key: It is a primary key composed of multiple columns, ensuring uniqueness by considering the combined values of the columns.
What are Relationships in a relational database?

Relationships in a relational database define connections and associations between tables, representing how data in one table is related to data in another table.
What is a 1:1 relationship?

A 1:1 relationship represents a relationship between two tables where each record in one table is associated with at most one record in the second table, and vice versa.
What is a Many:Many relationship?

A Many:Many relationship represents a relationship between two tables where multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in the second table, and vice versa. An intermediary table is usually required to establish this relationship.
What is a 1:Many or a Many:1 relationship?

A 1:Many relationship represents a relationship where a record in one table can be associated with multiple records in the second table, but a record in the second table is associated with at most one record in the first table.
A Many:1 relationship is the inverse of a 1:Many relationship, where multiple records in the second table can be associated with a single record in the first table.
