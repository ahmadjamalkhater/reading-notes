# Title: Introduction to Stacks and Queues

In this lesson, we will explore two fundamental data structures: stacks and queues. Stacks and queues are both linear data structures, meaning that they organize and store elements in a sequential manner. They have specific rules for adding and removing elements, which give them unique characteristics and make them suitable for different types of problems.

Stacks:
A stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of books or plates, where you can only access the topmost item. Here's how a stack works:
What: A stack is a collection of elements that supports two main operations: push and pop.
Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack is called a push operation. The new element becomes the top and the previous top is now below it.
Pop: Removing the top element from the stack is called a pop operation. The element below the top becomes the new top.
Why: Stacks are useful for managing function calls, undo/redo operations, and parsing expressions, among other things.
How: Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Array-based implementations have a fixed size, while linked list-based implementations can dynamically grow.
Queues:
A queue is an abstract data type that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Think of a queue in a movie theater or a line of people waiting for a bus. Here's how a queue works:
What: A queue is a collection of elements that supports two primary operations: enqueue and dequeue.
Enqueue: Adding an element to the end of the queue is called an enqueue operation. The new element becomes the last element in the queue.
Dequeue: Removing the first element from the queue is called a dequeue operation. The element that was added first gets removed.
Why: Queues are useful for implementing algorithms like breadth-first search, scheduling tasks, and handling requests.
How: Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Array-based implementations have a fixed size, while linked list-based implementations can dynamically grow.
In conclusion, stacks and queues are essential data structures that offer different ways of organizing and manipulating elements. Understanding their characteristics and usage scenarios is vital for solving various programming problems efficiently.
